let pattern = {
	tiles: [
		[],
		[]
		// can be 2 or 3 or even more
	],
	adjacencies: [],
	weight: 1
}

let adjacency = {
	patternIndex: 3,
	direction = [1, -1]
	// owner pattern can be placed to the DIRECTION of a PATTERN_INDEX pattern
}

third parameter for processInput to enable/disable rotations and reflections?
